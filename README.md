# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to practice using AWS, pyspark, and Postgres to extract, transform, and load data. We analyzed the difference between reviews given by Vine and Non-Vine members to determine if their was a bias. Of the 50 datasets, I analyzed the "Jewelry" data set. 

## Results

### Vine and Non-Vine Reviews

![Table One](/Resources/Ratings.png) 

There were 21 vine reviews and 7689 non-vine reviews. Vine reviews only made up 0.27% of the total reviews. Of the 21 vine reviews, 11 were 5 star reviews. 52.38% of the vine reviews were 5 stars. Of the 7689 non-vine reviews, 4444 were 5 star reviews. 57.80% of the non-vine reviews were 5 stars.

## Summary

### Conclusions 
I can conclude from this analysis that there is no bias for 5 star reviews among vine and non-vine members. I can conclude this because a larger portion of the non-vine members gave 5-star reviews, so the vine members were actually more critical in their reviews. I would analyze the other datasets to see if this conclusion is true on a larger scale.
